                    Read the side of the card displayed to you and think about what 
                    the answer could be. Then, click the card to flip it and find out 
                    if you were right. Click one of the difficulty buttons to rate how 
                    hard of a card it was. You can rate cards as very hard, very 
                    easy or something in between.
