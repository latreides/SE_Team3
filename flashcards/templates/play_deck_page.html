                Click the card or hit the space bar to "flip" the current card.<br>
                <br>
                Once the card has been flipped, rate how difficult you thought the card was
                using the "Very Hard... Very Easy" buttons. You can either click on them, or
                use the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 buttons at the top of your keyboard for Very Hard,
                Hard, etc, respectively.<br>
                <br>
                You can also just skip the card altogether by clicking the "Skip" button, 
                or by using either the left or right arrow key.<br>
                <br>
                You can click the wrench in the upper right hand corner to access your Settings 
                where you can change which side of the card is initially displayed to you.<br>
                <br>
                Click the "?" Help button again to close this drawer.
